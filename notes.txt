Bit repro tests:

* -acc            (gpu)
* -acc=multicore  ("openmp")
* -acc=host       (serial)

Should these agree?  If not: How can we produce equivalent tests for GPU?

Concerns:
   - What if we (or the compiler) simply forget or misfire a copy in/out of
     device?  Is this detectable?
   - Agreement across devices?  (eg Ampere vs Hopper)

i.e. What is the maintenance costs of OpenACC/GPU directives?

benchmarking concerns

* PTX JIT seems to be enabled on default
  We probably don't want to include JIT compilation times...
  (Or do we?)
